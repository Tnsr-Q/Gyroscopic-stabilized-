### Current physics modules

- **RGEs**: Standard Model one-loop running is implemented. MSSM/GUT threshold effects remain placeholders and can be extended in `rge_service`.
- **Effective potential**: Uses a one-loop Coleman–Weinberg potential in the MS-bar scheme with μ ≈ h. Two-loop terms and gauge-fixing refinements are planned.
- **Bounce**: Provides an O(4)-symmetric shooting method without Coleman–DeLuccia gravity; the numerics are intentionally simple and guarded.
- **Inflation**: Implements vanilla slow-roll using U(h) and K(h). Background normalization for accurate scalar amplitude A_s is currently a placeholder.
